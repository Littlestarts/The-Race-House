<p>What is the Race House? Well it's everything! Think Great Gatsby because it is classic and it is a family affair in grand fair! As the Race House is housed inside of the Gideon Putnam, it is not a sports bar. It is sponsored by the Saratoga Automobile Museum that has several treasures on display to evoke your awe. It has the tangible sophistication that would make a Nick Carroway as comfortable as unreachable Daisy Buchanan or the seemingly affluent Jay Gatsby for that matter. As one writter put it, [it]] is "elegant without being overly ornate."</p>

<p>The Race House offers recreational karts for rent on an outdoor track. Karts can be rented in 15, 30, or 60 minutes sessions on a daily basis depending on weather conditions [this is a seasonal activity that runs through Labor Day]. Our karts use sturdy chassis complete with dedicated bodywork, for added driver safety. There are also single and double rental karts. The Race House is mindful of the multiuse purposes of the environment and outdoor tracks are for low-speed karts, strictly for amusement. Some karts have dedicated chassis equipped with low powered four-stroke engines or electric motors that go up to 15 hp (11 kW)that are designed for the safety of pedestrians, drivers and specifically for rental use.
    
    Patrons are welcome to arrive anytime during track hours(12pm-8pm Sun-TH, 11am-9pm F-Sat) to race at a reasonable price, without appointments or the challenge of having to own their own equipment and gear.We provide all necessary safety gear, though the Saratoga Automobile Museum gift shop offers a beautiful selection of racing gear for the whole family featuring the museum logo. They have race wear styled after some of their special collections vehicles and personalities from various eras including modern/contemporary models. The Race House safety gear includes helmets, gloves and safety eyewear. All gear and machinery are cleaned daily and throughout the day, however, each patron is given disposable helmet liner, disposable gloves, individually disinfectant wipes to clean eye gear. Additional paper wipes and disinfectant sprays are at cleaning stations. Seating and steering wheels of all karts are available to be cleaned at the cleaning station after each use as well.
